# RobotFight

Simple desktop application based game made as part of the course "Eseményvezérelt Alkalmazások" at ELTE. 

Includes three versions of the same game: one with a WinForms client, one with WPF, and one with Avalonia (both desktop and Android client), all of them using the same model and file based persistence layer.
Main difference is the UI design and the architecture : MV vs MVVM, as is supported (or at least encouraged) by the frameworks.

Commit history is empty as at the time of creation it the project wasn't tracked via any VC system.
